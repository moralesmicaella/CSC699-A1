### Notes
The most challenging part in this assignment is adding a trailer in our flix app. It was a challenge on how we could utilize some codes that we have used in the first part of the assignment with only some variations, especially that we haven't fully explored network requests yet.

### Notes
The guide in building this app was clear and concise, that is why I didn't encounter any problems. However, since I'm still new to Swift and iOS development, doing the bonus features was probably the challenging part of this assignment, specifically familiarizing myself with constraints in order to make the app viewable in different device sizes and orientations.
